# DiffGeoLib

A small library for animating parametric plane curves. Plots curve, 1st derivative and 2nd derivative.

Intended as a pedagogical tool for vector calculus and differential geometry courses.

Written for python 3.x.

## Examples
The red vector is the first derivative of the curve. The green vector is the second derivative.
